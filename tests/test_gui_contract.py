"""M10l gate: ``docs/gui_contract.md`` cannot rot.

The contract page exists so a GUI — written later, elsewhere, in a technology
nobody has picked — can be built against a surface that is frozen *before* it
starts. A page like that is worth exactly as much as its accuracy, and every
field list on it is one refactor away from being a lie.

So nothing on that page is trusted here. Each list is compared against the
thing it describes: the exit codes against the runner's constants, the
``status.json`` fields against the keys a real run writes, the progress payload
against a real payload, the output-folder listing against a real folder. The
one concession is the cupy-only ``env_report`` block, which cannot be produced
on a CPU box — those names are checked against the source text of
``caustica/env.py`` instead, which still catches a rename.

# What has been measured

Every solver milestone is gated by tests against **analytic references** — O'Neil
(1949) focused bowl, the Rayleigh integral, Fubini nonlinear harmonic growth,
exponential absorption, plane-wave dispersion — **and** cross-validated against
[k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org) running as a registry solver on identical grids,
media and sources.

None of this is a claim made in prose and checked by hand: all of it is
automated under `pytest`, and a milestone does not close until its gate is green.

## Current evidence

- **Plane-wave dispersion.** Phase-speed error < 0.1 % at 4 points per
  wavelength; measured absorption within 1 % of the configured α.
- **3-D focused bowl vs O'Neil.** Focus within one voxel, axial correlation
  r > 0.99, −6 dB widths within 5 %.
- **Westervelt vs Fubini.** Second-to-first harmonic ratio within 5 % (measured
  0.9–3.2 %) across σ = 0.06–0.61.
- **`linear` vs `kwave`.** Against the real OMP binary, 2-D water:
  normalized-field correlation r > 0.99.
- **Calibrated source amplitude.** The realized plane amplitude matches
  `source.amplitude` on both the native and the k-Wave path, invariant to grid,
  CFL and remote medium content. For a *curved* source the same calibration
  needs the source to carry its own area rather than its voxel count — see
  below.
- **Grid refinement, 1.9 to 15 points per wavelength.** An f/1.2 bowl in a few
  cubic millimetres of water at dx = 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 mm. Axial
  correlation with O'Neil reaches 0.998 by 7.5 points per wavelength and
  plateaus; the −6 dB width lands within 0.1 mm.
- **Two propagators on one digitized source.** Over the same ladder, the native
  solver and k-Wave converge onto each other: focal peaks 8.7 % apart at 3.8
  points per wavelength and 0.2 % apart at 15, where both land on O'Neil's
  absolute prediction to within a percent.
- **A 32-element spiral array vs the Rayleigh integral** over its true element
  discs: 1.001× at fifteen points per wavelength, converging from 1.142× at
  3.75.
- **One phasor convention library-wide.** `p(t) = Re{P·e^(−iωt)}`, shared with
  the analytic references — see [the conventions that bite](conventions.md).

## How a curved source is represented, and why it matters

A flat source is easy: one voxel per `dx²` of aperture, exactly. A curved one
is not, and getting it wrong costs an absolute pressure rather than a shape.

Until 2026-08-24 a bowl was a one-voxel-thick shell with every voxel driven
alike. A digitized spherical cap crosses **1.18 voxels per `dx²` of its own
area**, so the bowl radiated in proportion to its voxel count instead of its
area, and the on-axis focal pressure sat 1.13–1.17× O'Neil's closed form. That
figure did *not* shrink with resolution — flat from 3.8 to 15 points per
wavelength — because a staircase factor is a property of digitizing a tilted
surface, not a discretization error. Nothing in the gates above would have
caught it: they compare normalized shape, peak position and −6 dB width, all of
which agreed well and improved with dx.

A bowl is now an **off-grid source**: the cap's closed-form area is divided
over equal-area quadrature points and each is deposited through a band-limited
interpolant, so the grid weights sum to that area whatever the surface's
orientation. This is the method k-Wave adopted for the same problem (Wise, Cox,
Jaros and Treeby, JASA 146, 2019). Measured over the same three rungs, the
absolute level now goes 1.136 → 1.023 → **0.999**, while the binary shell's
stayed at 1.162 → 1.146 → 1.165 — the difference between an ordinary
discretization error and a bias.

Two practical consequences:

- **A band-limited source is not thin.** It reaches a couple of voxels beyond
  the cap in every direction and carries negative weights in the interpolant's
  side-lobes; both are correct, and both mean a bowl needs slightly more
  clearance from the absorbing layer than its shell did. The constructor warns
  when part of the drive falls outside the domain.
- **`discretization: "binary"`** in a job's `source.array` block restores the
  old shell, for reproducing a result computed before this change.
- **Element arrays get the same treatment, for a bigger reason.** Their
  elements used to be rounded onto the voxel lattice, which is up to half a
  voxel of path length to the focus and a *different* error per element, so it
  defocuses instead of averaging out: 0.61 rad rms on the production spiral at
  dx = 0.5 mm, costing 17.6 % of the coherent focal sum. Graded against the
  Rayleigh integral over the true element discs, the old voxelizer goes
  0.861 → 0.931 → **0.951** across 3.75 → 15 points per wavelength and is still
  5 % short at the finest; the off-grid elements go 1.142 → 1.018 → **1.001**.

## What is *not* validated yet

The CuPy backend is packaged and has run on A100 hardware, but its parity and
full-size gates are not closed. Every number on this page was measured on the
**CPU** path.

This page is the ledger: a gate appears here only once something has measured
it, and what is missing from it is missing on purpose.

Two of these gates are drawn, at the scale they are actually run, on the [examples page](examples.md): the focused bowl against O'Neil, and nonlinear steepening against Fubini.

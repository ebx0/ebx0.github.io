# Geometry

Shapes are **implicit**: a shape is a predicate on a point, so it lands straight on whatever
grid you ask for at whatever resolution you chose. There is no meshing step and no resampling
of a mesh — rasterization evaluates the predicate per voxel, optionally supersampled.

Booleans are operators on shapes, so `(a | b) - c` is a shape like any other and can be
rotated, translated and rasterized as one.

## Segmented volumes

For anatomy that was never a solid: a labelled volume from a segmentation, resampled onto
your grid. Anatomical phantom datasets are built by a separate consumer
application and enter through `caustica.io.medium_volume`; caustica ships none.

## Off-grid sources

A binary voxel mask cannot represent the area of an oblique surface: a digitized spherical
cap crosses about 1.18 voxels per `dx²` of its own area, and since the engine drives every
source voxel alike, a shell-shaped bowl radiates in proportion to its voxel count instead.
These functions describe a source as a *measure* rather than a set of voxels — the surface's
closed-form area, spread over grid weights by a band-limited interpolant — which is what
makes a curved source's realized amplitude match the one that was asked for.

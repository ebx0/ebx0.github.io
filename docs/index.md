# caustica

<p class="hero-tagline" markdown>
**GPU-accelerated, multi-solver acoustic simulation for HIFU and therapeutic ultrasound.**
Pure Python — NumPy on the CPU, CuPy on the GPU. No compiler, no precompiled binaries,
and the same four commands on a laptop and in a Colab cell.

<small markdown>
An isometric cutaway of a real solve, from the transducer's apex plane up to the focal plane:
the converging cone on the two cut walls, the focal spot on the top face. Brightness is |P|,
rippled by Re{P·e^(−iωt)} over one acoustic period — so the loop closes on itself exactly.

!!! warning "Pre-alpha, and honest about it"

    The API still moves between milestones. Every solver result quoted on this page is
    **CPU-validated** against analytic references and cross-checked against k-Wave. The
    CuPy backend is packaged and has run on A100 hardware, but its parity and full-size
    gates are not closed yet — see [what has been measured](validation.md)
    for what is done and what is not.

## Quickstart

No checkout, no external data — the example job ships inside the wheel.

=== "Command line"

    ```bash
    pip install "caustica[report] @ git+https://github.com/ebx0/caustica"

    caustica example water_bowl_mini      # copies a packaged, self-contained job here
    caustica validate water_bowl_mini.json
    caustica run water_bowl_mini.json     # seconds on CPU; writes runs/water_bowl_mini/
    caustica report runs/water_bowl_mini  # local HTML + figures
    ```

    Prefix each line with `!` and the same four commands are a Colab cell.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import caustica

    res = caustica.simulate(
        "water_bowl_mini.json",   # a job path, a job dict, an ExplicitJobConfig, or a BuiltJob
        solver="westervelt",
        harmonics=(1, 2),
        out=None,                 # None = in memory; a path = the full run folder
        progress="auto",
    )

    res.metrics        # focal metrics — the definitions the HTML report quotes
    res.result.phasor  # the complex field, as the solver produced it
    res.save("result.h5")
    ```

    `out=None` writes nothing at all, but it does **not** skip the planner or the two
    pre-run gates: a run that will not fit in VRAM, or that a CPU would take hours over,
    is refused here exactly as `caustica run` refuses it — same message, same exit code,
    carried on `SimulationError.exit_code`.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The rest of the Python API](library.md)

Five worked examples — a focused bowl against O'Neil, nonlinear steepening against Fubini,
focusing through bone, a steered 128-element array, and a sonication carried through to
thermal dose — are on [the examples page](examples.md). Every figure and number there came
back from a run, not from memory.

## How it fits together

Ten decisions, in the order you meet them — and none of the thumbnails is a mock-up.

<div class="howto" markdown>
![How to use caustica, in ten steps](assets/how-to-use-real.svg#only-light)
![How to use caustica, in ten steps](assets/how-to-use-real-dark.svg#only-dark)
</div>

<small markdown>
Each one is drawn by calling caustica: the absorbing profile, the constructive geometry, the
spiral element table, the steered Rayleigh preview, the Fubini harmonics, the planner's own
estimate, and the axial line and focal plane of a real solve. `python scripts/make_howto.py`
regenerates the diagram.

## What you get

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-cube-outline:{ .lg .middle } **One job file, one full run**

    ---

    A `caustica-job/1` JSON names the grid, the medium, the source, the drive and the
    solver. `caustica schema` prints its JSON Schema, generated from the models — the
    documentation cannot drift from the code.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Job reference](job_reference.md)

-   :material-shield-check-outline:{ .lg .middle } **It refuses before it wastes your GPU**

    ---

    The planner times a step, inventories the engine's actual buffers and estimates
    wall-clock, then refuses a run that will not fit or that a CPU would take hours over.
    The refusal names the fix for the machine you are on.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: The planner](library.md#planner-will-it-fit-how-long-will-it-take)

-   :material-layers-triple-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Anatomy in, per-voxel physics out**

    ---

    Constructive solid geometry, or a segmented volume resampled onto your grid, with
    every label carrying sound speed, density, absorption and B/A.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Medium kinds](job_reference.md#medium-kinds)

-   :material-check-decagram-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Gated by analytic references**

    ---

    O'Neil, Rayleigh, Fubini, exponential absorption, plane-wave dispersion — plus k-Wave
    running as a registry solver on identical grids. All automated under `pytest`.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: What has been measured](validation.md)

-   :material-power-plug-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Five extension points, frozen names**

    ---

    Solver, medium kind, array kind, backend, report renderer. A third-party package plugs
    into any of them over entry points, without touching caustica.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Extending](extending.md)

-   :material-monitor-dashboard:{ .lg .middle } **A contract a GUI can rely on**

    ---

    The run folder, the exit codes, `status.json`, `error.json`, the cancel signal and the
    progress payload. Nothing outside that page is a contract.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: GUI contract](gui_contract.md)

## Solvers

One API, a registry of engines:

| name | physics | dims | backend | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `linear` | linear full-wave k-space PSTD | 1/2/3-D | numpy (cupy: M7) | validated |
| `westervelt` | nonlinear Westervelt k-space PSTD, multi-harmonic capture | 1/2/3-D | numpy (cupy: M7) | validated |
| `kwave` | [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org) `kspaceFirstOrder` via `k-wave-python` | 2/3-D | external binary | wrapped + cross-validated |
| `kzk` | parabolic KZK (z-marching) | planned | — | M9 |

Swapping engines is one string: `solver="kwave"` runs the same job through the real k-Wave
binary, on the same grid, and the two results are compared in CI.

## What has been measured

Every solver milestone is gated by tests against analytic references **and** cross-validated
against k-Wave on identical grids, media and sources:

- plane-wave phase-speed error **< 0.1 %** at 4 points per wavelength; measured absorption
  within **1 %** of the configured α
- 3-D focused bowl vs O'Neil (1949): focus within **one voxel**, axial correlation
  **r > 0.99**, −6 dB widths within **5 %**
- Westervelt vs Fubini: second-harmonic ratio within **5 %** (measured 0.9–3.2 %) across
  σ = 0.06–0.61
- `linear` vs `kwave` (the real OMP binary), 2-D water: normalized-field correlation
  **r > 0.99**
- one phasor convention library-wide, `p(t) = Re{P·e^(−iωt)}`, shared with the analytic
  references — see [the conventions that bite](conventions.md)

## Where to go next

- **[Examples](examples.md)** — five worked cases, each one solved to produce its own figure.
- **[Conventions that bite](conventions.md)** — the five assumptions that make a result
  *silently* wrong if you get them backwards. Read this before you trust a number.
- **[API reference](api/index.md)** — generated from the docstrings, so it cannot drift.
- **[Performance](benchmarks.md)** — measured per-step cost, and what is honestly not
  measured yet.
- **[Changelog](changelog.md)** — what has been built, in the order it was built.
